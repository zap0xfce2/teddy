# Tonie file tool

With this tool you can dump existing files of the famous audio box or create custom ones.

# My M0ds

- Changed the UI for better handling
- Removed the dialog if you want to change the audio id
- Removed the dialog if you sure about that you just want to convert one file
- Made the infolabel clickable so you can quickly open a folder
- Comming soon: 
	- you can replace the content ;)
	- fixed the log (clear after finish) ... maybe scrolling?
